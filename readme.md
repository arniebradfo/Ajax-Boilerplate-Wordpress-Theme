#  HTML5 Reset+PJAX WordPress Theme

HTML5 Reset+PJAX is a simple set of *WordPress* best practices to get web projects off on the right foot. It alos includes support for the combination of the .js history API and AJAX to enable faster loads and dynamic page transitions.

## TODOs:
1. Add hover prefetch option to increase performance ( copy: http://miguel-perez.github.io/smoothState.js/ ).
2. X - Add manual change to the wp .active class of the correct <nav> element.
	X - Add exception for the home page
	X - work on ancestor matching
3. X - Split initialLoad out from ajaxDelivered.
4. Test browser implementation inconsistencies of popstate.
5. Improve href matching:
	X - add exception for #id links.
	X - add support for subdomains. subdomain is included in document.domain
	0 - add exception for /wp-admin even if admin is a custom url suffix.
		will now work with the "wp-" prefix but if someone is trying to hide their login url, it shouldn't be in the .js on the front end. Write advisory that this will break.
6. Write documentation. "stick with the syntax wp uses to write nav links"
7. X - Alter <head> info on ajax call
8. X - Research and reduce SEO problems with ajax
	this should work fine because the stie will still function normally without js. all the links have accurate urls
9. X - Make it work with google analytics
10. research best keywords for naming
11. Possibly handle image loading differently? - image loading is out of scope
12. refactor functions to the appropiate type: anonymous, public, etc...
13. feature detect to allow gracefull degredation.
14. 0 - send out events onCall, onProgess, and onDelivered
15. ajax the comments section to live reload
16. switch everything from jQuery to regular .js
17. add support for wp admin bar edit button.
